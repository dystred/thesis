Choice of signal ->
	value -> evaluating the mispricing with a lower value equal to higher potential of losses
	absolute value -> evaluating mispricings and assuming both mispricing would lead to lower future return
	only the negative values -> only looking at the overpriced puts and if this is priced differently in the market
	squared mispricing -> 
	
mean-variance optimizing investors ->
	does it make sense ? 
	how have it been disproved
	what other masurements are there
