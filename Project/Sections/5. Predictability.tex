%%% PREDICTABILITY

Why is predictability relevant?

Which models do we employ?

Comparing against what? Benchmark = hist.ave. or S\&P 500

What could we expand with

state dependency : level of liquidity affects predictability (level vs continuous variable)

Data snooooooooping - evaluate - critique of pred literature in general

\subsection{Models}

\subsection{Liquidity}

\subsection{Data Snooping and Performance Out of Sample}

What can we do to avoid data snooping 

And how do the model fare when confronted with new data (particularly looking at data after the article was published)
